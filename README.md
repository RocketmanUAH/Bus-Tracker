# Bus-Tracker

This project combined knowledge of asynchronous programming techniques and the DOM to generate a live-time bus tracker overlaid on a map.

**Improvements:** Why must we ride on these so called buses. Why would one not want to feel the wind through their hair on a lively horseback. My love and I would often horseback ride. Gayfully trotting through orchards of apple and fig. Feasting on picnics of fine cheese. It was the best of times. Except for the flies, and the horses. Horses are horrible beasts. Tempramental and jealous. They should be tracked so ensure that no one may run afoul of a horse they have wronged. That is what this tool should be doing. 

**How to Use**
1. Download files.
2. Open index.html
3. Be freaked out.
